# Max Eisen's Advent of Code
Welcome to Max Eisen's Advent of Code solutions!

So far I've only done a couple solutions in 2023's AOC, but hopefully I can complete some more this year and keep it going in future years! Probably doesn't help that I only did day 1 on Dec 23 :/

## 2023
My first year doing AOC! Tried to organize my files and code as best as I could. The `2023` directory contains a separate directory for each day. Most (if not all) will just have a code file (`dayX.py`). Input files not included as per request of AOC creator.

## Run it Locally
All the code is in Python (so far). Just install Python and run it using VS Code, or an IDE, or even from the command line using `python dayX.py`... I don't care what you do!

**NOTE**: You'll need to add your own input file, in the day's directory, titled `input.txt` to run the code successfully.

Since each day has two parts, I created a constant in the bottom part of the code file for you to set the part of the question you're running (either `1` or `2` - don't give it invalid input... that's just rude).

Most importantly - **ENJOY**!!
